Basil,"dandy_basil(Discord),dand3basil@gmail.com","Happy anniversary! Individually, you have that charm that makes us wanna join in this quest. Axel,thank you for being a lively big brother and gladiator. That passion does lead to some good moments. And even when you do show it less, your sweetness is worth sharing. For Altare, you rule slime leader. From your gentle deameanor, to your cooler side, you are worth admiring.

Now.. Whatever lies ahead is anyone's guess. But thank you for being here leading the Starry Adventurers. Here's to more stories, and the new people we will meet in the future!",,

Happy Anniversary Leadah & Aniki! I want to let both of you know that I'm happy to celebrate this wonderful day together with everyone. I always appreciate your time and effort to create content and be close with us. Remember that we're here to support both of you & also don't forget to take care of yourselves to avoid being sickly. We always want the best for both of you.
 
Love lots,

Vantablack,v4vantablack (Discord),"May Axel always be spicier than Toramane's slap when he demonetizes the stream, and may Altare always be shinier than rpr's bald head. Thanks for all your hard work bringing smiles across the world, Happy Anniversary, Shiny Spicy! You should treat yourself to something nice, NOW!",,
