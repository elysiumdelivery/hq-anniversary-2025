Your patient yet active gameplay taught me to keep a good ear out for enemies (both players and monsters), use dark sight wisely and efficiently, and, of course, ALWAYS KEEP MOVING.  I’d say the two of you made a big success of it!  Whether it was two bullets and a dream or a hectic extraction under gunfire, you stayed cool under fire, and your conversations with Vesper were a treat!</p> <p>Thanks, Leader, for a great stream!</p>",

Everyone was so invested that there&#39;s a lingering sentimentality when it&#39;s finally over. Being their first time in a proper competitive tourney, there were a lot of things they learned and experienced, making for a great story full of fun and stressful moments.</p> <p>Altare, despite only joining at first to help his friends, learned about how big V-Saikyo is, and what an amazing opportunity it was to get themselves out there. Axel was able to improve and felt more confident in his IGL-ing, but decided he might try being a fragger next time.</p> <p>Most importantly, this made Axel interested in joining more competitive games and to make friends with many different people, potentially opening up more opportunities for the future.

He’s Pretty shy but he’s trying his best for the Axelotls! :D</li> <li>One of the precious streams as Jerry was being mentioned in here. He was sick and needed to be taken to the Vet a few times. :’((</li> <li>Throw your Q&amp;A: Mostly Anime, Games and JPOP ( A lot of interesting stuff to tackle!)</li> <li>Papa Syrios has been influenced by Japanese Culture since Kindergarten. Wow!  At 20 years old, the first time he played games was on a Super Nintendo ES with his close cousin.</li> <li>It&#39;s Merch Time! (While Papa Syrios works in the background) Aniki’s Nihongo Jouzou segment was actually an ear-candy moment 0///0</li> <li>A few top picks from Papa Syrios if you want to check it out: Zero 4 Champ, Kamen Rider (V3, Faiz), Super Robot Wars, Megazone 23, Doraemon and Queen Millenia.</li> <li>If the timing is right then Papa Syrios will come back to art, but more preferred traditional than digital. Not a natural artist he said, but Axel says otherwise.</li> <li>When it comes to booze; beer is the best. Maybe with a good wine, and Vodka on the side. No hard stuff though. ( Kanpai!)</li> <li>He loves to cook what people enjoy to eat: From a simple Steak to Fried Rice, name it.~</li> <li>Papa Syrios’ chosen JP Idols: If you want a touch of disco, folk, jazz, Latin, and R&amp;B then you might need to hear the lovely Nakamori Akina. On the other hand for hip-hop, EDM, and J-pop then AKB 48 is a great choice too with their cute aesthetic! </li> </ul>",

Everyone’s path is different. That you kept going, even when times were tough, is admirable. That you did all that, helped take care of your family and pets, held a steady job, and entertained a bunch of little idiots like us is absolutely incredible! It’s hard enough just to work a part time job during uni, let alone a full time one. </p>\n<p>We saw your frustrations. When you were tired and annoyed, when you probably wanted nothing more than to just sit down in silence, when you had late nights. But you would still be there, streaming, recording, singing, and working hard. We couldn’t do much for you, but we hope that, in some small way, all of us were able to make those rough days better. You were always there for us when we needed it, so we wanted to be there for you too. </p>\n<p>Really and truly, congratulations, Axel. We’re all so proud of you and everything you’ve accomplished.  </p>\n<p>Love, \nThe Axelotls</p>",

The boys met up, went to Altare's place riding his beautiful steed, ate some cookies and pizza and&ndash; oh, Flayon has just killed Altare by hugging him.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving on! They got bagels, met with a friend and went for karaoke, where they got </span><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scammed</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> persuaded to buy a giant bottle of &ldquo;Not Bettel 1&rdquo; for a 2-hour session. It cost $400 but hey, they got to keep the bottle!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bettel is </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scared of Flayon at all. Especially knowing that Flayon watches him sleep, and occasionally sleepwalks </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sleep talks with no recollection of it in the morning. How pleasant!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The boys have an arm wrestling match, to which Bettel wins against Altare with his killer right arm! Surely his left arm is just as&ndash; oh, Altare obliterates him easily. But at least he has a killer right arm!&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For absolutely no reason other than the hee hee hahas, they do another round of butt kicking&ndash; except this time Altare's crotch suffers the consequences. What a fun time!&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They talk about going on a 3 AM walk together, which was actually kinda nice and relaxing and not at all creepy. It felt like a filler episode of an anime where the characters bond and we can feel their growth.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other fun things the boys do that are completely normal and fun: Furb Doll shenanigans, group pushups, playing limbo until their backs hurt, pouring water down Bettel&rsquo;s pants, and practicing viral dance moves! Truly a &ldquo;boys in the shower room&rdquo; experience!</span></li>\n</ul>",

Thank you for also teaching us very important fashion tips, such as how derby shoes have peaky blinders, your tie should be as wide as your sleeve width, your belt should be the same color as your tie, and how trinity knots, when drawn, do not look like their name at all. We also learned from Leader that “Axel stinks” and that the acrylic stands “uh…yeah they look cool, hey?” It was super entertaining, and I really hope we can experience TEMPUS having more fun together like this in the future!</p>",
