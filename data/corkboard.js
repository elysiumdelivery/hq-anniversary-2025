Your patient yet active gameplay taught me to keep a good ear out for enemies (both players and monsters), use dark sight wisely and efficiently, and, of course, ALWAYS KEEP MOVING.  I’d say the two of you made a big success of it!  Whether it was two bullets and a dream or a hectic extraction under gunfire, you stayed cool under fire, and your conversations with Vesper were a treat!</p> <p>Thanks, Leader, for a great stream!</p>",

Everyone was so invested that there&#39;s a lingering sentimentality when it&#39;s finally over. Being their first time in a proper competitive tourney, there were a lot of things they learned and experienced, making for a great story full of fun and stressful moments.</p> <p>Altare, despite only joining at first to help his friends, learned about how big V-Saikyo is, and what an amazing opportunity it was to get themselves out there. Axel was able to improve and felt more confident in his IGL-ing, but decided he might try being a fragger next time.</p> <p>Most importantly, this made Axel interested in joining more competitive games and to make friends with many different people, potentially opening up more opportunities for the future. Thanks to TSB, he was able to be closer friends with his teammates and coaches, and made many great memories with them that he&#39;d cherish forever.</p>",

He was sick and needed to be taken to the Vet a few times. :’((</li> <li>Throw your Q&amp;A: Mostly Anime, Games and JPOP ( A lot of interesting stuff to tackle!)</li> <li>Papa Syrios has been influenced by Japanese Culture since Kindergarten. Wow!  At 20 years old, the first time he played games was on a Super Nintendo ES with his close cousin.</li> <li>It&#39;s Merch Time! (While Papa Syrios works in the background) Aniki’s Nihongo Jouzou segment was actually an ear-candy moment 0///0</li> <li>A few top picks from Papa Syrios if you want to check it out: Zero 4 Champ, Kamen Rider (V3, Faiz), Super Robot Wars, Megazone 23, Doraemon and Queen Millenia.</li> <li>If the timing is right then Papa Syrios will come back to art, but more preferred traditional than digital. Not a natural artist he said, but Axel says otherwise.</li> <li>When it comes to booze; beer is the best. Maybe with a good wine, and Vodka on the side. No hard stuff though. ( Kanpai!)</li> <li>He loves to cook what people enjoy to eat: From a simple Steak to Fried Rice, name it.~</li> <li>Papa Syrios’ chosen JP Idols: If you want a touch of disco, folk, jazz, Latin, and R&amp;B then you might need to hear the lovely Nakamori Akina. On the other hand for hip-hop, EDM, and J-pop then AKB 48 is a great choice too with their cute aesthetic! </li> </ul>",
