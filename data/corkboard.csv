Seeing you and Vesper play Hunt: Showdown was a blast! The game itself has great atmosphere, and your helpful teamwork, pleasant chatting, and awesome clutch shots just made it better.  Your patient yet active gameplay taught me to keep a good ear out for enemies (both players and monsters), use dark sight wisely and efficiently, and, of course, ALWAYS KEEP MOVING.  I’d say the two of you made a big success of it!  Whether it was two bullets and a dream or a hectic extraction under gunfire, you stayed cool under fire, and your conversations with Vesper were a treat!

- When it's too dark to see, have a cheeky nap with your homies right next to each other
- Hunt some animals and wear them as a hat. It gives you a visibility debuff, but hey, it's for aesthetics!
- Turns out it’s not a good investment to make a shovel if you’re only getting dirt and stones. Axel suggests grave digging instead
- Making a couch IS a necessity! Couch co-op with the boys!!

Being their first time in a proper competitive tourney, there were a lot of things they learned and experienced, making for a great story full of fun and stressful moments.

Altare, despite only joining at first to help his friends, learned about how big V-Saikyo is, and what an amazing opportunity it was to get themselves out there. Axel was able to improve and felt more confident in his IGL-ing, but decided he might try being a fragger next time.

Most importantly, this made Axel interested in joining more competitive games and to make friends with many different people, potentially opening up more opportunities for the future. Thanks to TSB, he was able to be closer friends with his teammates and coaches, and made many great memories with them that he'd cherish forever.","<p><b>TSB’s First Tourney!</b></p> <p>Despite placing 17th, TSB had grown and achieved a lot in V-Saikyo, being the first full EN team to participate.

- First off, Papa Syrios’ avatar’s so cool. He’s Pretty shy but he’s trying his best for the Axelotls! :D
- One of the precious streams as Jerry was being mentioned in here. He was sick and needed to be taken to the Vet a few times. :’((
- Throw your Q&A: Mostly Anime, Games and JPOP ( A lot of interesting stuff to tackle!)
 - Papa Syrios has been influenced by Japanese Culture since Kindergarten. Wow!  At 20 years old, the first time he played games was on a Super Nintendo ES with his close cousin.
- It's Merch Time! (While Papa Syrios works in the background) Aniki’s Nihongo Jouzou segment was actually an ear-candy moment 0///0
- A few top picks from Papa Syrios if you want to check it out: Zero 4 Champ, Kamen Rider (V3, Faiz), Super Robot Wars, Megazone 23, Doraemon and Queen Millenia.
- If the timing is right then Papa Syrios will come back to art, but more preferred traditional than digital. Not a natural artist he said, but Axel says otherwise.
- When it comes to booze; beer is the best. Maybe with a good wine, and Vodka on the side. No hard stuff though. ( Kanpai!)
- He loves to cook what people enjoy to eat: From a simple Steak to Fried Rice, name it.~
- Papa Syrios’ chosen JP Idols: If you want a touch of disco, folk, jazz, Latin, and R&B then you might need to hear the lovely Nakamori Akina. On the other hand for hip-hop, EDM, and J-pop then AKB 48 is a great choice too with their cute aesthetic!

- Instead of proper introductions, start by slapping each other's butts! (This was not rehearsed) 
- It's Friday the 13th! Altare is constantly teleporting into Bettel, Bettel has nosferatu hands, and Flayon’s neck broke from fooling around too much. Everything is fine. 
- Altare, who is the most normal of them all, goes around talking to police officers and cashiers, asking random questions like why the stop sign is shaped that way. That's our psychopathic very normal Leader!
- Story time! The boys met up, went to Altare's place riding his beautiful steed, ate some cookies and pizza and– oh, Flayon has just killed Altare by hugging him.
- Moving on! They got bagels, met with a friend and went for karaoke, where they got scammed persuaded to buy a giant bottle of “Not Bettel 1” for a 2-hour session. It cost $400 but hey, they got to keep the bottle!
- Bettel is not scared of Flayon at all. Especially knowing that Flayon watches him sleep, and occasionally sleepwalks and sleep talks with no recollection of it in the morning. How pleasant!
- The boys have an arm wrestling match, to which Bettel wins against Altare with his killer right arm! Surely his left arm is just as– oh, Altare obliterates him easily. But at least he has a killer right arm! 
- For absolutely no reason other than the hee hee hahas, they do another round of butt kicking– except this time Altare's crotch suffers the consequences. What a fun time! 
- They talk about going on a 3 AM walk together, which was actually kinda nice and relaxing and not at all creepy. It felt like a filler episode of an anime where the characters bond and we can feel their growth. 
- Other fun things the boys do that are completely normal and fun: Furb Doll shenanigans, group pushups, playing limbo until their backs hurt, pouring water down Bettel’s pants, and practicing viral dance moves! Truly a “boys in the shower room” experience!","<p><strong>A Very Normal 3D Off-Collab (Boys in the Shower Room Edition)&nbsp;</strong></p>
